                    <p class="faqp1">The One8 cube is the nerve centre of your One8 internet experience. It is a hotspot router and entertainment platform, all in one sleek, intelligent box. It is loaded with a music and video player, and soon, a rich selection of on-demand video streaming and gaming services along with a browser so you can surf on your television. With two USB ports and Bluetooth capabilities, you can connect external hard disks, keyboard, mouse and more. </p>
                 
                    <p class="faqp" >How many devices can I use with the One8 cube? </p>
                    <p class="faqp1">Use upto 8 wifi-enabled devices (laptop, tablet, phone etc.), and that’s not all. Turn your TV into a smart TV — just plug it into the One8 Cube’s HDMI port. </p>

                    <p class="faqp" >Can I download apps on the One8 Cube? </p>
                    <p class="faqp1">Your One8 is pre-loaded with some of the most popular apps like Youtube, TED, Gmail, Facebook and more. Our team of app curators continuously refresh-es the selection, giving you the best range of pre-loaded apps to enjoy. And if there’s something more that you’re after, with our lag-free network, you can download unlimited apps on all your wifi enabled devices. </p>

                    <p class="faqp">My connection has been activated in the middle of the month. How will this affect my bill or billing cycle? </p>
                    <p class="faqp1">On activation, you will be charged the chosen plan cost. In the following month, we will credit the number of days that you have not used the One8 plan. For in-stance, if your connection was activated on 10th of September, you will be given a credit for 9 days usage in the next month’s billing, and the amount will be adjusted. The billing cy-cle spans 30 days, beginning on the 1st of every month. </p>


                    <h1 class="h1-font">Plans </h1>

                    <p class="faqp">How do I choose a plan? </p>
                    <p class="faqp1">With our speed-agnostic plans, the only question you need to ask your-self is how much data you need — because with One8, lag-free speed is a guarantee. If you are unsure of how much data you typically use, start with our Basic Package. If you need more, you can Top Up with ease or migrate to a new plan at the tap of a finger. Once you finish your data for the month, while you will be able to continue surfing, as per FUP rules, your speed will be capped at 512 kbps. </p>

                    <p class="faqp">How do I change my plan? </p>
                    <p class="faqp1">Current plan too limited? Upgrade with ease <a class="external" href="${pageContext.request.contextPath }/service"><b>here</b></a>. Once we receive your request, our customer care executive will be in touch with you in 2-3 business days. </p>

                    <p class="faqp" >Can I get a low speed, low rental plan? </p>
                    <p class="faqp1">Your One8 plan is based solely on data consumption. Our thinking network constantly allocates the best speed, depending on what you are doing. If you want to switch to a lower rental, simply choose a smaller data package <a class="external" href="${pageContext.request.contextPath }/service"><b>here</b></a>. </p>

                    <p class="faqp">Is there a fee for changing plans? </p>
                    <p class="faqp1">Not at all! </p>

                    <p class="faqp">Can I carry forward my GB? </p>
                    <p class="faqp1">If you opt for a plan with a bigger data package, your unused GB from the current month will be automatically adjusted against the new plan. If you are moving to a smaller data package, then your used data will be calculated — if it is more than the limit on your new plan, the FUP will take effect immediately.  </p>

                    <p class="faqp">Can I upgrade my plan in the middle of a month? 
                    <p class="faqp1">While you can change plans at any time, the new plan will only take ef-fect at the beginning of the next billing cycle. </p>


                    <p class="faqp">I have finished my data for the month. How do I top up? 
                    <p class="faqp1">Get your Top Up on the go <a class="external" href="http://marcus.oneeight.co.in/zeno/topup"><b>here</b></a>. It’s easy, quick and takes effect instant-ly. </p>


                    <h1 class="h1-font">Billing </h1>

                    <p class="faqp">What is my billing cycle? </p>
                    <p class="faqp1">All our plans are on a 30-day post usage, post paid cycle. This means that you will be billed every 30 days, starting on the 1st of every month. </p>

                    <p class="faqp">How do I pay my bill? Can I pay online and offline? </p>
                    <p class="faqp1">Paying online is super simple. Click here and pay by card or net banking through a safe and secure payment gateway. To pay online, <a class="external" href="http://marcus.oneeight.co.in/zeno/payment"><b>click here</b></a>. </p>


                    <h1 class="h1-font">Network </h1>

                    <p class="faqp">What is the thinking network? </p>
                    <p class="faqp1">There is a reason we call our network the thinking network — our power-packed analytics engine that continuously gauges the perfect speed you need for the applications you use in real time. The fact is that not every user in your home requires the same speed all the time because not every user is using the same application at the same time. The One8 network detects usage at an individual level and allocates speed according-ly to individual users— lower for an email, higher for streaming a video or a video confer-ence. What that means is that no matter what you are doing online, you will be doing it lag-free. That’s the power of the thinking network. </p>
